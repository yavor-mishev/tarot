# pixi-projection

pixi-projection is a plugin for Pixi.js that adds support for 2D projections. It allows you to create 3D-like effects in your 2D games and applications. The way it achieves this is by adding a new `ProjectionSprite` class that extends the regular `Sprite` class. This new class has additional properties and methods that allow you to manipulate the sprite in 3D space.
